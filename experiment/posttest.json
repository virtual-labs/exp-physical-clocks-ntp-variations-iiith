      "question": "How often does NTP typically synchronize clocks in a well-configured system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Every second",
        "b": "Every minute",
        "c": "Every hour",
        "d": "Every few minutes to several hours, depending on the stability"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: This is too frequent.",
        "b": "Incorrect: This may be too frequent for many systems.",
        "c": "Incorrect: This is not typically frequent enough.",
        "d": "Correct: NTP adjusts the synchronization frequency based on the stability of the network and the clocks."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following can impact the accuracy of NTP synchronization?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Network delay variability",
        "b": "The size of the data packets",
        "c": "The number of network nodes",
        "d": "The operating system used"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: Network delay variability can significantly impact NTP accuracy.",
        "b": "Incorrect: The size of data packets is not a major factor in NTP accuracy.",
        "c": "Incorrect: The number of network nodes does not directly affect NTP accuracy.",
        "d": "Incorrect: While different operating systems may handle NTP differently, it is not the primary factor affecting accuracy."

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the 'offset' in NTP?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It indicates the difference in the current time and the correct time",
        "b": "It measures the round-trip delay",
        "c": "It shows the amount of data transferred",
        "d": "It encrypts the time packets"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: Offset is the difference between the local clock time and the reference clock time.",
        "b": "Incorrect: This is the role of delay, not offset.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Offset does not relate to data transfer.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Offset does not involve encryption."

      "question": "In the context of NTP, what is the significance of the Marzullo algorithm?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It improves the encryption of time packets",
        "b": "It helps in selecting the best time source from multiple servers",
        "c": "It compresses time synchronization data",
        "d": "It measures the delay of time packets"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: The Marzullo algorithm is not related to encryption.",
        "b": "Correct: The Marzullo algorithm is used in NTP to select the best time source when multiple servers provide time data.",
        "c": "Incorrect: The Marzullo algorithm does not compress data.",
        "d": "Incorrect: The Marzullo algorithm is not used to measure delay."

    {
      "question": "How does NTP handle leap seconds to ensure accurate timekeeping?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By pausing the clock for one second",
        "b": "By speeding up or slowing down the clock gradually",
        "c": "By introducing an offset at the beginning of the next hour",
        "d": "By inserting or deleting a second at the specified time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: NTP does not pause the clock.",
        "b": "Incorrect: NTP does not gradually speed up or slow down the clock for leap seconds.",
        "c": "Incorrect: NTP does not adjust the offset at the beginning of the next hour.",
        "d": "Correct: NTP handles leap seconds by inserting (adding) or deleting (subtracting) a second at the specified time to adjust the clocks accordingly."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
